# Sentiment Analysis by Fusing Text and Location Features of Geo-tagged Tweets

In this project, I study the fusion of text and location features for the sentiment classification task. CNN, BRNN, BiLSTM, Transformer are used in the experiments for binary and multiclass classification. This project is the extended work of the citation below.

Original dataset: full_text.txt in [Geo-tagged Microblog Corpus](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~ark/GeoText/)

The data, saved model weight, and variable used in the code can be downloaded [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/19_U96nHctqsoOo0wZS2eK7Dr8DjzLV22?usp=sharing).
